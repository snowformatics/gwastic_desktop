# 1. Installation  

GWAStic software was build and successfully tested on Windows operating system (Windows 7 and 10).

### Windows:

> [!TIP]
> We recommend to install Anaconda and  for managing dependencies, it is often recommended to create a new environment for your project:

Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Open the Anaconda Prompt
```
conda create --name gwastic_env python=3.9
conda activate gwastic_env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install GWAStic via pip:
> 
`pip install gwastic_desktop`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run GWAStic:

Type `gwastic` in the Anaconda command line to start the software.

### Linux:

### MacOS:

> [!TIP]
> We recommend to install Anaconda and  for managing dependencies, it is often recommended to create a new environment for your project:

 Install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

Open the downloaded .pkg file to launch the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

Open Terminal. You can do this by pressing Cmd + Space to open Spotlight Search, typing "Terminal", and pressing Enter.

```
conda create --name gwastic_env python=3.9
conda activate gwastic_env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install GWAStic via pip:

`pip install gwastic_desktop`

For MacOS it's important to update matplotlib via conda:

`conda install matplotlib`


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run GWAStic:

Type `gwastic` in the command line to start the software.



# 2. Supported input file formats and example datasets
- VCF file format (including vcf.gz) and Plink BED (binary) format are supported for all GWAS methods. In case of vcf, you first must convert the genotype data to bed file format. 

[VCF example file](https://github.com/snowformatics/data/blob/cd8ac371fe669711430a6a4d7c00960082b3cd4b/gwastic_test_data/example.vcf.gz)

- Phenotypic data must be three columns (Family ID; Within-family ID; Value) text or CSV file delimited by *space*.

[Phenotype example file](https://github.com/snowformatics/data/blob/cd8ac371fe669711430a6a4d7c00960082b3cd4b/gwastic_test_data/pheno.csv)

We provide tow datasets to test GWAStic:

> [!TIP]
> We provide to two datasets to test GWASTic and validate the software:

### Dataset 1 (Barley with row-type phenotype):

>  We have used a subset of data from a recent study (Milner et al.2019) focusing on the genetic basis of barley traits. The genotypic
data was filtered by applying a genotyping rate cutoff of 0.02 and
a minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold of 0.05. This resulted
in a curated dataset comprising 949,174 SNPs. A random subset
of 147 accessions from the Core 200 collection in the same study
with available row-type phenotype data was selected. This
phenotype describes the arrangement of kernels on the spike of
the barley plant, specifically distinguishing between two-rowed
and six-rowed barley - a crucial morphological and agricultural
trait. The four distinct methods - XGB, RF,
LR, and LMM - were employed to validate the peaks of two rowtype
associated barley genes previously identified in (Milner et
al. 2019).
